I'm trying to create a slug for the catergory of an event.
The slug is seo friendly in a website. 
It goes in the url;
https://example.com/blog/seo-tips-for-2025

here in below link "seo-tips-for-2025" is a slug, don't get confused with routes like "/blog/" here those are different.

I was able to create slug, 
It's nothing more than creating any other module > includes create, findall, findbyId, delete, update etc.
I have wrote all the code using gemini, I will write the same code next time as well.
